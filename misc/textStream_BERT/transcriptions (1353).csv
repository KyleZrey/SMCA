Secondly there was considerable doubt if a human could take it. They were prophecy, experienced sailors. Then there was the mystery man, Don Crowhurst. This was the classic tale of English daring doing homegrown British error. There's nothing essential about this, I suppose. The boat isn't ready. If he dropped out early on in the race, my father would be bankrupt. He had staked everything on being successful in the race. We initially thought this was a man who had made transatlantic voyages, but he was almost a weekend sailor. The thing about single-handing is it puts a great deal of pressure on man. This was not just an adventure but a very dangerous undertaking. He was playing the character of the long-distance sailor. If Don went forward, he was committing suicide. If he came back, he was ruined. He's not where he's supposed to be. He's not in the South of the ocean. He's just off the coast of Brazil. At that point he could slip in beside her to rejoin the race. Psychiatrists said that a human would go mad if they tried to do it.

Mr. Keats knows he cannot like you. He has no living and no income. He was a dreamer. Have you got John Keats's poem book? My sister has met the author and she wants to read it for herself to see if he's an idiot or not. She was a realist. All I wear I've sewn and designed myself. Ben's room, out.

As if the air has sucked out from my lungs. Mr Keats is very brilliant. Was it successful? You taught me love. You never said only the rich. I must warn you the trap that you're walking into, John. You'll lose your freedom permanently. For what? You are already the source of so much gossip. Apparently there is nothing I can do to persuade you of the gravity of the situation. We must cut the threads. No. I can't. I never will. You know where we'd do anything. It is a game. It is a game to her. It is a holiness to the heart's affection. You know nothing of that.

I said, my God, they've killed him. It became plausible to me that this man wasn't even guilty of anything, and he was murdered in detention. We put people in a crazy situation, and people do crazy things. People were being told to rough up Iraqis that wouldn't cooperate. We were also told they're nothing but dogs. Interrogators were telling the guards, strip this guy naked, chain him up to the bed in an uncomfortable position, do whatever you can. You had these young soldiers with very little training, just as the rules were changing. And they weren't told what the new rules were. You start looking at these people as less than human, and you start doing things to them you would never dream of. And that's where it got scary. It was only the night shift. There's always a few bad apples. The brass knew. They saw them shackle them hooded, and they said, right on, y'all are doing a great job. There were emails from FBI personnel down in Guantanamo saying, you won't believe what's going on down here. We've got to disassociate ourselves. You have no right to a lawyer. You have no right to witnesses. You don't really know what the charges are, and you certainly don't know what the secret evidence is against you. They saw an intentional decision taken at the height of the Pentagon to put out a fog of ambiguity. We have to work the dark side, if you will. We're going to spend time in the shadows. What starts at the top of the chain of command drops like a rock down the chain of command. American values are premised upon the notion of human dignity. We don't know what revenge is coming down the road. There will be no outrages upon human dignity. It's very vague."

The guy died, put him on a gurney, he was gone. Go about your business, keep working. That's the first time I started taking photos. Everybody knew, everybody that was inside of that prison, they had the pictures. They gave me thousands of pictures from all the job. Everyone tried to tell me he's too old for you, he's a bad guy.

I took more pictures now to record what's going on. We were told no pictures of prisoners. Even though I was stupid enough to fall for it, I mean, he used me.

There's not a powerlifter on the planet that doesn't know the name Westside Barbell. If you go to a meet and you see the Westside crew, you know that shit just got real. Because their names were on all the records. It was like it said, federal penitentiary on the side, they took all the bars off and opened the doors. It was almost worse because they could leave and come back. It got kind of violent in there. I kept thinking, well, they're going to all start fighting here in a minute.

West side was Everest. What the fuck do you do after Everest? You come up with something new and crazy and different, the first thing people are going to do is deny it. If you're afraid to fail, you'll never succeed. He's changed the sport. Looking back on it, it's like what was the positive quality of all of it? I don't know. But we all got stronger. Why would somebody not like west side barbell? People popped up in the 2000s, they only hated since then. It was like the good guys and the bad guys. We're the bad guys, no doubt. Where in the fuck is west side barbell? Where is Louis Simmons? You need to come challenge the king. West side barbell and Louis Simmons changed power lifting. And whether you liked it or not, it happened. So you get an idea of what we do here at west side. That's part of the history. You don't train west side until you're in west side. I think west side barbell is what it's supposed to be, it's an animal. Before west side barbell, there was never a west side. And after west side, there'll never be a west side.

I have never been treated like this in my 30 years in academia. I lost my job. It's a funny thing that questions that aren't properly answered don't go away. How did we get from an inorganic world to the world of the cell? It might have started off on the backs of crystals. So you have no idea how it started? No, no, nor has anybody. Nor has anyone else. So intelligent designers believe that God is the designer. It is about as unlikely as fairies, angels, hobgoblins, etc. Science makes no use of the hypothesis of God. I mean, it's essentially official policy of the National Academy of Science that religion and science will not be related. There are people out there who want to keep science in a little box where it can't possibly touch a higher power, cannot possibly touch God. Must be some movie. Expelled. No intelligence allowed.

At the Walt Disney Studios from 1984 to 1994, a perfect storm of people and circumstances changed the face of animation forever. But it almost never happened. Here it is, April 9th, 1980. This is the pass to all you folks out there. And we're going to go inside and see what it's like. Come on. Revision. A hundred drawings go in the trash. The fact is that the last couple of animated movies made were not particularly good. That year, we were beat out at the box office by the Care Bears movie. We knew we hit rock bottom when the studio told us that we were being kicked out of our own building. I think after that meeting we all kind of said, we're going to make great films. The work was intense, the hours were long, and there was only one thing that could stop it all. Margaritas. This crew is the best crew. It's fabulous. Can you really do what you want to do in animation? That's what we have to do in this company. That is our legacy.

The real heartbeat of this company was, is, and will always be the film business. That fueled one of the greatest comebacks in entertainment history. And the winner is Beauty and the Beast.

Adam, your material up there seems like it's running a little thin. What the heck? I think Barrow might have one great story left in her. This is solid ice. It goes for five miles from here to the open ocean. Three gray whales are now trapped in walls of ice six inches thick. You have whales in trouble and you didn't call me? I didn't call you because there's nothing you can do. There's always something you can do. Rachel, I'd like you to meet Fred and Wilma and this is Van Van. Everything's gonna be okay. Governor Haskell, we were wondering if you could mobilize the ship that can break through the ice. You're serious? You're serious? With every passing hour, their path to freedom slips further away as more of the ocean turns solid. All we need is the cooperation from the governor, but the governor has basically turned his back on the whales. I hate her so much. We will do everything we can to help these poor creatures. Pretty amazing, huh? The National Guard will pull the icebreaker where it's desperately needed. The poor should be a piece of cake. Nothing's that simple in the Arctic. Ice is a monumental task as all eyes and efforts are focused on saving the whales. The temperature has dropped through the floor. We can't keep up with the ice. The town of Barrow has shut down. As school children and shopkeepers alike furiously work to cut a path to the ocean. Where's Van Van? He's not coming up. Maybe he's hurt. You can't go down there. It's too dangerous. The only icebreaker within navigable distance belongs to the Soviets. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let the Reds in to save the day. Then those whales are going to die.

tt1567233.mp4," This could be the first generation of children in the United States that lives less than its parents. I got two pills I take for my diabetes, then I got one for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and then I take Bieta, which is an injectable. I'm getting really shaky, and I'm sick and I'm fatigued, and that's when they diagnosed me with hypertension and diabetes. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure cost this country more than $120 billion each year. People are saying, you're crazy, you're a cancer patient, you should be resting. Doctors told me this. When I had the second heart attack, the doctor said, I should prepare for death. Heart disease is an absolutely toothless paper tiger that need never, ever exist. People who were raised in Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, never had heart disease, prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis. This is the atlas of cancer mortality in China. Virtually the Western diet was nonexistent. They had no animal products, they had no dairy, no meat. We learned that we could turn on and turn off cancer growth just by adjusting the level of intake of that protein. I knew at that point what caused most diseases. Our national authorities are simply excluding this concept in order to protect the status quo. With the Western diet, there are going to be half a million people in this country this year who will have to have the front half of their body divided. They're heart exposed. Some people would call that extreme. I know of nothing else in medicine that can come close to what a high-based diet could do. If you go through life thinking that what happens to you from a health perspective is based on your genes, you're a helpless victim. I've reversed the diabetes. The diabetes is not coming back. I just can't understand what it's done to change my life. Diet is so much more important than anybody ever thought. To me the answer is so simple, it's criminal. It's just people starting to take responsibility for their health and starting to eat more plant-based foods. It's that simple."

Same thing the US does, nobody even shot their family members. You know, they see somebody bomb a school when all these people get killed, so the United States feel like, ooh that's messed up, we gotta go show them who's the real killer.

Before that, the Carter administration. Before that, I was a special aide to Abraham Lincoln. Of all developed nations, the United States has the most unequal distribution of income and we're surging toward even greater inequality. 1928 and 2007 become the peak years for income concentration. It looks like a suspension bridge. Last year we made $36,000. I think I probably make $50,000 a year working 70 hours a week. The middle class is struggling. People occasionally say to me, what nation does it better? The answer is the United States. In the decades after World War II, the economy boomed, but you had very low inequality. You know Robert Reich? I do. He's a communist. When I was a kid, bigger boys would click on me. I think it changed my life. I had to protect people from the people who would beat them up economically. Who is actually looking out for the American worker? The answer is nobody. Workers don't have power if they don't have a voice. Their wages and benefits start eroding. We are losing equal opportunity in America.

We're toast as a country. The sugar industry is extraordinarily powerful. They're in business to make money, not to keep America healthy. What if our whole approach to this epidemic has been dead wrong? The government is subsidizing the obesity epidemic. We place private profit ahead of public health. Systematic political failure. By 2050, one out of every three Americans will have diabetes. Those diseases are being driven by sugar. This is the fundamental problem nobody's talking about in society. We could cure 80% of the problem where they prepared the food in the school. Tomato paste is a vegetable? Really? Junk food companies are acting very much like tobacco companies did 30 years ago. I would reject entirely any argument that they are in any way harmful. Lying through their teeth. Kids are being told the biggest lie they will ever hear in their lives. Ronald McDonald never sells to children. He informs and inspires through magic and fun. If a foreign nation were doing that to our children, we would defend our families. Years from now, we're going to say, I can't believe we let them get away with that. You have to change the diet of America. It's all preventable."
